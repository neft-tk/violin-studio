          CANCELLING LESSONS:
        </h2>
        <p>

          24 hour notice is required for a cancellation, this includes illness. If the cancellation is under 24 hours and cannot be done via ZOOM/SKYPE that lesson will count towards the 30 lesson requirement. Cecilia will offer one make-up lesson due to a student's illness if the student is too sick to do a ZOOM/SKYPE lesson.
        </p>
        <h2>
          TEACHER ABSENCES:
        </h2>
        <p>
          If Cecilia is mildy sick she will teach over ZOOM. If she is too sick to ZOOM the lesson she will make up that lesson.
        </p>
        <h2>
          ONLINE LESSONS:
        </h2>
        <p>
          Online lessons via ZOOM/SKYPE are a great option for a student who is mildly sick, traveling, or has a last minute scheduling conflict that makes it impossible to get to the Buss studio for an in person lesson.
